// Purpose: Five books are going through a single file catalogue system.
// So they went in one after the other. Because the system follows a single file queue, the output comes in reverse order of entry.
// What boook would you see first, second, â€¦, and the last? Choose a
// suitable data structure to simulate the cataloguing, add the five books to the data structure, and then get them out using proper
// operations. You should write a Java method named enterQueue to simulate the data entry process, and a Java
// method named leaveQueue to simulate the process the five books being stacked in reverse order. Then call the two methods in
// the main method to test the two methods;
