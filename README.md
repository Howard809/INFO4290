Repository for the Github Assignment - Group - Part 2 in INFO 4290 S10 and S50

Purpose: Design and implement another Java class named BookShelf which has an ArrayList data member named bookList to store books. 
The class should have suitable constructors, get/set methods, and the toString method, 
as well as methods for people to add a book (prototype: addBook(Book book)), remove a book (prototype: removeBook(Book book)), 
and search for a book (prototype: findBook(Book book)).
Test the two classes by creating a Bookshelf object and five Book objects. Add the books to the bookshelf. 
Display the contents of the bookshelf. Test the removeBook and findBook methods as well.
